<p>Hey, Just wanted to come on here and say that I'm struggling with issues against korrine (Or kai.) And it might not make me do stuff on here for a while. If you need me to fix something, just ask in school though. I will add it to a list of things that need done. But genuinely, Korrine made me depressed as shit, and made me genuinely unhappy. I love all of you who care about me. You guys are part of the reason I like life. You guys who genuinely want to see me win are the best people ever. Love you guys so fucking much. Back about korrine. She has gotten all my information, and she knows some thing's about my past that I am not rather fond of. She could try and blackmail me into giving her what she wants. But if this information got out, I'm done. (more tmrw)
